## üìù Technical Notes

### Auto-Save Implementation
Uses custom `useAutoSave` hook with 1-second debounce. Saves data automatically as user types, with visual feedback showing "Saving..." and "Saved" states.

### Multi-Client Support
Each client has unique slug-based URLs (e.g., `/client/northwood-outdoor`). All data is isolated per client with proper foreign key relationships.

### Catalog Integration
MyShed catalog data is stored in read-only reference tables. Client configurations reference catalog items by code, allowing for flexible pricing and availability overrides.

### Progress Calculation
Each section tracks completion status. Overall progress is calculated based on completed fields across all sections, displayed prominently in the sidebar.
